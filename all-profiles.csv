For example, a Contract Resource may be automatically populated with the values expressed in a related QuestionnaireResponse. However, the Contract Resource may be considered the legally binding contract if it is the only “executed” form of this contract, and includes the signatures as *The Contract Resource may function as the computable representation of an application or offer in a pre-executed Contract if the grantor has not entered any values.

If the grantor has filled in the legal form or the associated Questionnaire Response, then these values are used to populate a pre-executed Contract Resource.If the Contract.topic is considered an application or offer, then the policy is often required to be attached as the “legal” basis for the application to ensure “informed consent” to the contract, and that any discrepancy between the application and the policy are interpreted against the policy.  Implementers should check organizational and jurisdictional policies to determine the relationship among multiple representations of a contract pre- and post-execution.","In the context of a contract, the topic is the matter under consideration in regards to which specific rights, privileges, obligations, restrictions, and prohibitions are binding on any grantor and grantee parties upon the execution of the contract. Given the wide range of contract topics, implementers need to be cognizant of the business use case for which they are designing a FHIR Contract, and narrowly specify the topic being represented with respect to the Contract.type and any specializing Contract.subtype. The same topic, e.g., an asset such as a good or service, such as a real property, medical supply, insurance, information, a procedure or employment, or a manner of conduct, such adherence to a privacy, trust, or security policy, may be the topic of multiple types of contracts. One way to determine the Contract.topic is to answer the question: “What is the object of negotiation?”Answer: The Contract.topic, which may be described with more detail in the [0..*]Contract.valuedItem @ [0..1] Contract.valuedItem.entity[x] Definition: Specific type of Contract Valued Item that may be priced.

","Extensions that cannot be ignored even if unrecognized","May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).","There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone.","Modifier extensions allow for extensions that *cannot* be safely ignored to be clearly distinguished from the vast majority of extensions which can be safely ignored.
